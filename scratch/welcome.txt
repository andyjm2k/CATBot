Welcome to the File Operations Feature!

This is a sample file to demonstrate the reading capabilities.

The assistant can now:
- Read this text file and others (txt, docx, xlsx, pdf, png)
- Write new files in various formats
- Process and manipulate document content

Try asking the assistant:
"Read the content from welcome.txt"

Or create a new file:
"Write a summary to my_summary.txt with the following: This is my first saved file!"

Enjoy exploring this new capability!
