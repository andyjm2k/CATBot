In quiet hearts where passion softly dwells,
Love blooms like dawn through shadows cast,
A flame that burns though tempests dwell—
Its light unyielding, fierce, and vast.

Through trials deep, it weaves a steadfast thread,
A bond no time nor distance can sever.
In every sigh, in every breath, it's bred,
A force that shapes the soul's desire.

Yet love is more than fleeting fire—
It's peace in chaos, hope in despair,
The silent vow that binds us dear,
A truth that time cannot erode.

So let me cherish this eternal spark,
For in its glow, I find my mark.
