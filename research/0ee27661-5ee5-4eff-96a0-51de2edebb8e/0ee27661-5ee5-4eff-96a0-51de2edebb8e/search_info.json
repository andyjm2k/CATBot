(page extracted from Montana State Curriculum Guide — see site for full document)\n\nNotes / caveats: \n- Explicit numeric sensory acceptance thresholds (e.g., accept if mean ≥ X on hedonic scale), precise panel‑size mandates, and hard time limits per recipe were uncommon in the public guides; instead best practices are: standardize recipes, test repeatedly (≥3 times for standardization), use structured taste‑scorecards (1–5 or 1–9 scales), define portion & yield, document prep/cook times, and compute cost per portion using yield tests. \n- I collected and extracted 10+ high‑quality resources covering practical checklist items across the five requested criteria (taste, balance, ease of execution, cost, time). If you want, I can: (A) convert these into a single consolidated printable checklist you can use for recipe development (one‑page checklist), or (B) extract additional authoritative PDFs (ICN, Florida DOH, TX CTE) if you upload them or provide direct accessible URLs. \n\nIf you want the one‑page checklist now, tell me whether you prefer a concise checklist for professional foodservice or a simplified home‑cook checklist and I will produce it.",

    "result": "Collected findings (concise summary — title — URL):\n\n1) Prioritise seasonal produce: Plan menus around seasonal availability to reduce environmental impact and cost, improve freshness and flavour, and avoid out-of-season imports (use frozen as appropriate). — Healthier and more sustainable catering: a toolkit for serving food to adults — https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/healthier-and-more-sustainable-catering\n\n2) Procure locally where practical: Cut food miles, increase freshness and support local economies by including local suppliers in tendering, specifying provenance and encouraging short supply chains. — Healthier and more sustainable catering: a toolkit for serving food to adults — https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/healthier-and-more-sustainable-catering\n\n3) Targeted organic purchasing: Buy organic selectively where it delivers clear sustainability or animal-welfare benefits (e.g., some dairy, meat, selected fruit/veg); prioritise organic for high-impact items rather than requiring all ingredients to be organic. — Government Buying Standards for Food and Catering Services (GBSF) / GOV.UK toolkit — https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/healthier-and-more-sustainable-catering\n\n4) Specify Fairtrade for traded commodities: Choose certified Fairtrade products for commodities such as coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar and bananas; require certification evidence in procurement documents and state whether you need full product FAIRTRADE Mark or Fairtrade Sourced Ingredient (FSI) for ingredients. — Fairtrade sourcing — https://www.fairtrade.net/sourcing\n\n5) Fairtrade benefits and procurement steps: Buying on Fairtrade terms secures fairer prices, Fairtrade Premiums and more stable contracts; procurement should request suppliers’ Fairtrade licence/certification evidence, reference Fairtrade standards in contracts and indicate which Fairtrade model is required. — Fairtrade sourcing — https://www.fairtrade.net/sourcing\n\n6) Verify organic credentials & labeling rules: Use the USDA NOP Organic Integrity Database to confirm certifier and certification status; follow NOP guidance for labeling (100% organic, organic, made with organic) and require suppliers to provide certifier name, current certificate and traceability in contracts. — National Organic Program | Agricultural Marketing Service (USDA) — https://www.ams.usda.gov/about-ams/programs-offices/national-organic-program\n\n7) Procurement contract practice for organics: In purchase orders/contracts require current USDA-accredited certification, correct labeling per NOP rules, supplier warranties of organic integrity, traceability obligations, and audit/record access. — National Organic Program | Agricultural Marketing Service (USDA) — https://www.ams.usda.gov/about-ams/programs-offices/national-organic-program\n\n8) Rainforest Alliance: register and manage certification via RACP and MultiTrace; choose and declare traceability model (mass-balance, segregated, identity-preserved), request supplier RA IDs, include certification/royalty costs in contracts, and require traceability transactions if retail-level claims are needed. — Retail and Foodservice Companies Now Included in Rainforest Alliance Certification and Traceability: What You Need to Know — https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/business/certification/retail-and-foodservice-companies-now-included-in-rainforest-alliance-certification-and-traceability-what-you-need-to-know\n\n9) Rainforest Alliance procurement practicalities: Use Supply Chain Risk Assessment (SCRA) to set verification level, request traceability evidence (MultiTrace transactions) when making volume/percentage claims, and allocate royalty/SD/SI responsibilities in supplier contracts. — Rainforest Alliance guidance (page above) — https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/business/certification/retail-and-foodservice-companies-now-included-in-rainforest-alliance-certification-and-traceability-what-you-need-to-know\n\n10) Industry practice — SRA: prioritise local/seasonal ingredients, favour farms using organic/regenerative practices, require Fairtrade/organic for high-risk commodities, embed sustainability definitions in a written procurement policy, audit suppliers, and build supplier relationships (visits, dialogue). — How Your Bar Can Put Sustainable Sourcing Practices in Place — https://thesra.org/insights/how-your-bar-can-put-sustainable-sourcing-practices-in-place/\n\n11) WWF practical guidance (food-service toolkit PDF): plan seasonally-led menus, define local sourcing radii and in-season lists, increase organic purchasing where it yields biodiversity/agrochemical benefits, prefer recognised certifications for traded commodities (Fairtrade, Rainforest Alliance, MSC/ASC), require supplier verification, traceability and KPIs, and adopt simple procurement checklists and measurable targets (% spend on local/organic/certified). — Sustainable Eating: Pulling The Levers In Food Service (WWF PDF) — https://www.wwf.org.uk/sites/default/files/2023-12/Sustainable%20Eating%20-%20Pulling%20the%20Levers%20in%20Food%20Service.pdf\n\n12) StratKIT public-procurement tools: provides downloadable checklist(s), tender templates with sample sustainability criteria, organic procurement criteria and tools to map local organic suppliers, guidance to include climate-impact, plant-based, waste reduction and packaging criteria in tenders, and references the EU Green Public Procurement criteria for sample wording and recognised certifications. These are directly usable for drafting tenders and supplier contracts. — Public Procurement - StratKIT Sustainable Public Meal Toolkit — https://stratkit.eu/tools/public-procurement\n\n13) Sustainable Food Places (SFP) Toolkit index: gateway/index to local/seasonal procurement guidance and partner tools; the index points to guides and tools (search within the Toolkit for procurement-specific templates and checklists). — SFP Toolkit — https://www.sustainablefoodplaces.org/toolkit/\n\nNotes on sources I could not extract fully here:\n- SARE 'Sustainable Food Purchasing Guide' PDF: located at https://www.sare.org/wp-content/uploads/Sustainable-Food-Purchasing-Guide.pdf but repeated extraction attempts failed in this environment (frame/context closed). Recommend downloading the PDF directly for extraction if you want its detailed checklists and vendor examples.\n- One Planet Network tools page was blocked by Cloudflare/turnstile (verification challenge) from this environment; if you can open it in a browser and paste or upload the page/PDF, I can extract procurement templates and summaries from it. URL: https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/programmes/sustainable-tourism/sustainable-food-systems/tools-resources\n\nIf you’d like, I can now:\n- 1) Extract the SARE PDF if you upload it or allow another attempt, or\n- 2) Search and extract one or two more industry/toolkit sources (e.g., Restaurantware, Sustain) to broaden the resource set, or\n- 3) Format the above findings into a compact procurement checklist or sample tender wording you can reuse in purchase documents.\n",
