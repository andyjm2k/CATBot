# Research Plan

- [ ] Define scope, goals and constraints for the novel recipe. Specify what “novel” means (new seasoning combinations, cooking method, plating), target audience (home cooks, restaurant service), dietary or allergy constraints (gluten-free, nut-free), sustainable sourcing requirements, and success criteria (taste balance, ease of execution, cost and time limits).
- [ ] Compile background research on blue swimmer crab (biology and culinary properties). Investigate seasonal availability and sustainable harvest practices, typical meat yield and texture, flavor profile (briny, sweet, delicate), common cooking methods (steaming, grilling, sauté, poaching), and food-safety considerations (storage, shelf life, required internal temperatures, shell handling).
- [ ] Survey existing recipes and inspiration sources. Collect 25–40 existing recipes from cookbooks, food blogs, restaurant menus and culinary journals that use blue swimmer crab or similar crabs; note common and unusual seasoning profiles, accompaniments, techniques, and plating. Also review flavor-pairing resources (databases, molecular gastronomy references) and cuisines with complementary profiles (Southeast Asian, Mediterranean, Latin American, indigenous Australian, etc.).
- [ ] Define target flavor direction(s) and generate candidate seasoning concepts. Based on step 3 and the crab’s flavor, choose 2–4 distinct culinary directions (e.g., citrus-fermented-umami; smoky-rosemary-goats’ butter; spicy tangy Southeast-Asian; nutty-herb crust). For each direction, create 8–12 candidate seasoning elements and techniques (dry rubs, marinades, compound butter, infused oil, pickled garnish, fermented paste) and list possible unique or regional ingredients to test (native spices, fermented condiments, seeds, citrus varieties, smoke types).
- [ ] Design a controlled testing plan and recipe prototypes. Decide on 6–10 recipe prototypes combining cooking method + seasoning + one or two accompaniments (starch, vegetable, sauce, beverage pairing). For each prototype define variables to control (crab weight and prep, cook time/temperature, seasoning concentration, resting time). Prepare standardized evaluation forms that capture objective measures (cooking yield, time, cost) and sensory ratings (aroma, salt balance, sweetness, texture, aftertaste, overall liking).
- [ ] Conduct iterative cook trials and sensory evaluations. Execute 2–3 rounds of cooking trials for each prototype in a consistent kitchen environment. Use a small tasting panel (6–12 tasters with at least some culinary-literate participants) or blind tests where possible. Collect quantitative scores and qualitative feedback on balance, uniqueness, and pairing with accompaniments. Note technical issues (shell difficulty, flakiness, moisture loss) and food-safety observations.
- [ ] Analyze results and refine to 1–2 final recipes. Synthesize tasting data to identify the most successful seasoning + cooking method + accompaniments. Adjust ingredient ratios, techniques (timing, temperature), and plating based on feedback. Conduct final validation runs including: a scaled test (larger portion), dietary variants (e.g., gluten-free, vegetarian side options), and beverage pairing tests (one wine, one beer, one non-alcoholic).
- [ ] Produce complete recipe documentation and deployment materials. Write precise, tested recipes with ingredient weights, step-by-step instructions, timing and temperatures, prep and cook yields, storage/safety notes, sourcing/sustainability guidance, and variation options. Add plating/photography notes, suggested accompaniments and beverage pairings, and an executive summary explaining what makes the recipe novel. Optionally prepare a short tasting notes sheet and a cost/time estimate for home cooks or chefs.
